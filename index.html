        <h1>Controls:</h1><br>
        Left Arrow - Move Left<br>
        Right Arrow - Move Right<br>
        Up Arrow - Jump<br>
        A key - Attack Left<br>
        D key - Attack Right<br>
        W key - Attack Up<br>
        S key - Attack Down<br>
        <br>
        While on top of a button, press E to activate the button.<br>
        <br>
        You can jump off of spike as long as you're not on them for longer than roughly a second<br>
        You can also climb walls or platforms by running into them and then jumping (don't hold the left or right arrow key)<br>
        <br>
        You can push boxes around to gain more height. You may need to jump on a spike and hit the box at the same time at some point ;)<br>
